I'm a PhD student in the Programming Languages Group at Delft University of Technology (in the Netherlands) under supervision of Benedikt Ahrens.
My interests include:
- Category Theory
- Semantics of Programming Languages
- Logic, (homotopy) type theory and formalization

I'm a contributor to the [UniMath library](github.com/uniMath/uniMath) which is a Coq library of computer-checked mathematics using the univalent point of view.
