Hi everyone, I am Kobe F. Wullaert.

I am currently a PhD student at Delft University of Technology (the Netherlands) working in the [the Programming Languages group](https://pl.ewi.tudelft.nl/).
In my PhD, I explore the topic(s) of category theory and categorical semantics in the context of univalent foundations, under the supervision of [B. Ahrens](https://benediktahrens.gitlab.io/).
In particular, I'm a contributor to the [UniMath library](github.com/uniMath/uniMath), which is a Rocq library of computer-checked mathematics using the univalent point of view.
Before that, I studied Mathematics at the University of Antwerp (Belgium) from which I've obtained my Bachelor's and Master's in (fundamental) mathematics.
In addition to my research, I greatly enjoy teaching and supervising students.

In this website, you can find some of my writings, such as my publications, older academic notes, and possibly presentation slides (and even a poster), and course notes.
Furthermore, this website contains information found in my CV, including a full list of talks and my teaching experiences.
