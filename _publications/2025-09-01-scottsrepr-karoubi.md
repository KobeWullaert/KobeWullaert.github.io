title: "Scott's Representation Theorem and the Univalent Karoubi Envelope"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/scottsrepresent-thm-karoubi
excerpt: "We present a formalization of Scott's Representation Theorem in univalent foundations. Specifically, we implement two proofs of that theorem, one by Scott and one by Hyland. We also explain the role of the Karoubi envelope -- a categorical construction -- in the proofs and the impact the chosen foundation has on this construction"
